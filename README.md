A certificate authority build upon Python &amp; Angular

The goal is to create an Ubuntu certificate authority which will be joined to a LDAP domain.
It will have a web interface which will:
 - authenticate users with LDAP
 - have a certificate request upload form
 - have a list to display the csr
 - have a list to display the issued/rejected certificates
 - have a screen to validate a csr
